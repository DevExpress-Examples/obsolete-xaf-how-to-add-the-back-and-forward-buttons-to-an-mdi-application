# OBSOLETE - How to Add the Back and Forward Buttons to an MDI Application


<p><strong>=================================</strong><br /><strong>This article is obsolete starting with v10.1. Use the built-in feature of the Document Manager component instead: <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#windowsforms/CustomDocument11362">Document Selector</a> </strong><br /><strong>=================================</strong><br />The built-in Back and Forward Actions allow end-users to navigate between previously invoked Views. These Actions are contained in the DevExpress.ExpressApp.SystemModule.ViewNavigationController. This Controller is not intended for use in applications with MDI strategy, because it collects a history of Views invoked in the application's main Window. In an MDI application, the main Window doesn't have any View; all Views are displayed in child Windows. So, the Back and Forward Actions are always disabled.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates how to create a custom WindowController that contains navigation Actions collecting Views from invoked MDI child forms. For details on this example, refer to the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/K18067">OBSOLETE - How to Add the Back and Forward Buttons to an MDI Application</a> article.</p>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In version 11.2.10, this example is simplified, because the MDI strategy is set using the UIType property of the Options node in the Model Editor. The Back and Forward buttons are added using a Window Controller, as it was in the previous version of the example. Although, several changes were made in this Controller because some internal classes have been changed in XAF.</p>
